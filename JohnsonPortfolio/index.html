  <h2>Hello Beautiful Person, who happened to stumble upon my website. I'm glad you're here, let me introduce myself briefly.</h2>
    <p>My name is Kaleb Johnson. I was born and raised in the quite interesting city of Bakersfield, CA. Currently I'm a nineteen year old entrepreneur, who's learning more and more about life and how to live everyday. Furthermore, I'm striving for greatness and trying to offer the best help for anyone else who wants to reach the goals and dreams. Some of my biggest motivators/inspirations are Gary Vaynerchuk and LeBron James. As of today though, I am currently about to embark on one of the hardest adventures of my life... A drastic lifestyle change. One committed to the grind and growth. Here I come Michigan!</p>
